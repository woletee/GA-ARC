# Auto-ARC: Automated Generation of ARC Tasks Using Genetic Algorithms

This repository is designed to generate new ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) tasks using (GA). The generated tasks adhere to specific transformation rules, ensuring that each new task is unique while following the same underlying principles.

## Features
Augumented ARC tasks

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
